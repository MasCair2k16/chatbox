# Goal
- Make this chatbox work with or without internet. 

# Mason's Work
- The folders Mason worked on:
  - DBChat.xaml.cs
  - MySqlDb.cs
  - Program
  - Settings.xaml.cs
  - UserNamePrompt.xaml.cs

# How it works
- When you start the program, you will be prompted to enter your username if you havent done so already. Once you enter your username, that user name then will be saved to a local file on your computer to remember your name.
- The main chat box will then appear with a previous messages from the users.
- On left side of the chat box are the current users in the chat database
- If you don't like your user name, you are given a choice to select settings (top right Logo). Click delete cookies. This will prompt you again for another username.
- To submit a message, all you have to do is click the text bar and type what you want the tap ENTER or click the paper plane logo
- To refresh, there is a refresh button on the left. I wasnt able to get the auto refresh button to work.

# Tips
- To see your name in userlist in chatbox, you need to submit message
- To chat with another user on IP, you both need to be push the connected button.
- Messages in chatbox are not auto refreshed like Messagebox. Push Refresh button to update.

# Notes
- If you run this program outside the Whitworth Domain, the database will not work, therefore your messages will not be sent.
- Everything is commented.
- To try Brycens work on merged project, you need to close internet adapter. This will then prompt you stating you are not connected to the internet and then Brycens program will appear

# CREDIT
- Brycen Martin and Mason Caird both work on this final project together. 
- Brycen worked on the Messagebox
- Mason worked on the Chatbox
- The merged file combines both of our code into the final work peace.
